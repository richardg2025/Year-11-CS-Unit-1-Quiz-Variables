# Year-11-CS-Unit-1-Quiz-Variables

Ensure that you read all instructions <b>carefully</b>. Do not include any additional variables or methods that are not specified in this quiz description. Each question is worth one mark and is binary, except for question 12, which is worth 2 marks. That is, you either get 1 mark or 0 marks for each question, again, except for question 12. There are 12 questions on this quiz hence this quiz is worth 13 marks in total. The <i>only</i> application that is to be running on your computer is your <b>IDE</b> (until you are ready to submit your quiz). When you are ready to submit your quiz, please share it on <b>github</b> and ensure that all of your work has been <b>pushed</b> to your repository. Double check this by <b>confirming</b> that your <b>completed</b> classes exist in your repository on <b>github</b>. Submit the <b>link</b> to your repository on <b>Schoology</b>. 

Good luck, have fun! :)

Inside the main method …
1. <b>Declare</b> and <b>initialize</b> a variable of type <b>int</b> called <b>age</b> to a value of <b>33</b>.
2. <b>Print</b> out the variable <b>age</b> using a <b>single</b> println statement. 
3. Declare and initialize a variable of type double called balance to a value of 18.89.
4. Declare and initialize a variable of type int called dollars. This variable should be equal to the value of casting the variable balance to an int. That is, if balance is equal to 18.89, dollars will therefore be equal to 18.
5. Declare and initialize a variable of type int called dollarsRounded. This variable should be equal to the value of casting the variable balance to an int but will round balance to the nearest integer. That is, if balance is equal to 18.89, dollarsRounded will therefore be equal to 19.
6. Declare and initialize a variable of type char called letter to a value of A.
7. Print out the variable letter.
8. Cast the variable letter to an integer and print it out. Do this in a single statement.
9. Increment the variable letter using the postfix increment operator.
10. Print out the variable letter.
11. Cast the variable letter to an integer and print it out. Do this in a single statement.
12. Explain what is happening in questions 10 - 14. Focus your explanation on character data types and integers.
